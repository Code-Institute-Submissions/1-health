# 1-health
Code institute and learning people first assessment project.

Mental health is such an important discussion that is gaining serious awareness in the past few years.
The idea behind the creation of the website is creating a platform that brings together images/clips and artistic quotes. 


A major aspect of the website is visual, intentionally simplistic with a white background& minimal color. The intention is to draw the viewers attention to the images, clips and quotes.

The images aim to grab the viewer, the clips provide further information about health on each page. Home clips introduce mental, physical and nutrition health and on each subsequent page go into further detail.

On mental, physical and nutrition has some minimal text on each page, which talks further about the background around each aspect of health.

The structure of each page is the logo and menu aligned horizontally. Three images, three clips and six quotes.
