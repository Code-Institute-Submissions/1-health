# 1-health
Code institute and learning people first assessment project.

Mental health is such an important discussion that is gaining serious awareness in the past few years.
The idea behind the creation of the website is creating a platform that brings together images/clips and artistic quotes about mental, physical and nutrition health.


UX-
This website for users who want to visit a site that talks about the importance of mental, physical and nutritional health in a visual manner.
The major information substance of the website is the clips; the clips can vary from thirty seconds to sixty minutes. With the ultimate goal to push forward the discussion around health and inspire individual to take control of their personal health.

Social media platforms such as instagram and snapchat has inspired the user experience for this website; minimal text and a combination of clips& images.

Features-
Logo on the far top left side of the page, with the menu horizontally aligned with the logo.
Three images displayed horizontally aligned; images are tailored to each particular health type.
Directly below are three clips displayed, aligned horizontally and discuss health in a entertaining, emotional and engaging way.
In mental, physical and nutrition pages there are minimal texts that alude to my own personal thoughts on those health subjects.
Six quote-images on each page as inspiration to the viewer that relates the health subject in a short artistic manner.
On each page is a footer that three links to external site, for the viewer to visit and discover more about health.

Existing Features-
The menu feature allows the user to move from home page, mental health, physical health and eat well pages. 
The clips feature brings the conversation the viewer in a entertaining and engaging manner, for example one clip features famous boxer/athlete Tyson Fury who is well known for his mental health issues and he talks openly about his mental health thus encourages others to do the same.
The footer feature allows users to investigate further on mental, physical and nutrition health. 


Features left to implement-
The consversation around health is constantlty evolving; a blog or similar feature where users can input their own mental health experience.
